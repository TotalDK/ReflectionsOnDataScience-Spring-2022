    "# Fermi estimates\n",

    "Often, you might find it useful to estimate the size of something without very much information. Rather than getting a precise answer, you might aim to get an order of magnitude estimate. The goal is to get a sense of the approximate size. This type of problem is known as a Fermi Problem, named for physicist Enrico Fermi. \n",

    "Here's an example of a Fermi problem: How many bicycles are sold in Denmark per year?\n",
    "* The population of Denmark is about 6 million people.\n",
    "* Let's say that around a third of Denmark are interested in bicycles. That's 2 million people\n",
    "* On average, a person who is interested in bicycles probably buys a new bicycle every 5 years.\n",
    "* That means that approximately $\\frac{6,000,000}{3*5} = 400,000$\n",
    "\n",
    "(The actual number in 2010 was about 500,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another example: how long would it take to count to a million (in English)?\n",
    "* 9/10 of the numbers are above 100,000 and would therefore take approximately the same time to say (\"nine hundred sixty-one thousand six hundred and forty-seven\" doesn't take that much longer to say than \"one hundred thirty-one thousand three hundred and forty-one\")\n",
    "* Using a stopwatch, I measured the time to say the numbers from 564,380-564,389. That took 31 seconds.\n",
    "* Assuming I could keep that pace up for the entire ordeal, that would make each number take 3.1 seconds to say\n",
    "* Thus, it would take $\\frac{1,000,000 \\cdot 3.1}{60\\cdot 60 \\cdot 24} = 36$ days to count to a million.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In 2007 a guy called Jeremy Harper counted to a million in 89 days at 16 hours per day = $\\frac{89\\cdot 16}{24}=59$ total days, so we were not far off)"
